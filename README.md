## NOTES
>The goal of a good readme is to keep people out of our source code

### WHAT THE README SHOULD DO
Tell me what this program is
Show you what is looks like in action
Show YOU how to USE it
All the other relevant information

### BONUS
EMBED AS MUCH INFO AS POSSIBLE. LINKS DIE
MAKE IT AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE
LINK out to other people to give them credit

### ORDER OF THE README, DONT CHANGE IT
X-NAME
X-One-line description
Usage -> GIF

### READE ME MUST INCLUDE
Project logo,
GIFs of using the project on the major views. ONLY the big things (project view, table, dashboard WITH sorting)
TOC
Badges - but only if they seem helpful. Who's the audience. DO they really need to know this info?
