## About
VISLIT came from my inability to easily manipulate the years worth of writing data I accumulated. Excel worked great for keeping track of words written but was too cumbersome when it came to having multiple writing projects, with different goals. Attempting to analyze that data to learn about my own writing habits was overly difficult. VISLIT aims to make all this easy.

## Installation

## Usage
1. Create writing projects and set daily, weekly, or monthly word count goals

2. Enter progress towards goals and specify whether you proofread, edited, or revised

3. View and sort progress with tables

4. Visualize progress with dashboards

## Roadmap
- Convert into an offline desktop application, using local storage (possibly by using [Electronjs](https://www.electronjs.org/))
- Improve UI/UX
- More data visualizations
- More indicators on goal progression
