## About
VISLIT came from my inability to easily manipulate the years worth of writing data I had accumulated. Excel worked great for keeping track of words written but was too cumbersome when I had multiple writing projects with different goals. VISLIT aims to make tracking, visualizing, and analyzing writing data easy.
